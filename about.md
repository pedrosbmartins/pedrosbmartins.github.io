Hey! 👋

I'm Pedro Martins, a software engineer based in Amsterdam.

I have over 7 years of professional experience in full-stack web and mobile development, software architecture, engineering best practices, and cloud infrastructure. I enjoy working on impactful projects and have been doing so at [Recharge](https://company.recharge.com/), a global platform for digital prepaid payments.

Before that, I was a partner and founding software engineer at [Grana Capital](https://grana.capital/), a Brazilian fintech startup.

I also have a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning.

Here's my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-martins-9729b71a3/) for more in-depth professional details.

When I'm not working on a software project, I'm usually reading a history book or looking at the stars through a 200mm Dobsonian telescope.

### Projects
